# Private Relay
Private Relay provides generated email addresses to use in place of personal
email addresses.

Recipients will still receive emails, but Private Relay keeps their personal
email address from being [harvested](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-a-landing-page-ht), 
and then [bought, sold, traded, or combined](https://www.bookyourdata.com/) 
with  other data to personally identify, track, and/or [target
them](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/606443329504150?helpref=faq_content).

## Development

Please refer to our [coding standards](docs/coding-standards.md) for code styles, naming conventions and other methodologies.

### Requirements
* python 3.7 (we recommend [virtualenv](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/))
* PostgreSQL - even if you are using sqlite for development, requirements.txt installs
  psycopg2 which [requires libpq](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html#build-prerequisites) and Python header files.
  The following should work:
    * [On Windows](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)
    * On Ubuntu: `sudo apt install postgresql libpq-dev python3-dev`
    * On OSX: `brew install postgresql libpq`
    * On Fedora: `sudo dnf install libpq-devel python3-devel`
* [SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) if you want to send real emails
* [Node 12.X](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) â€“ Needed for front-end SCSS compiling
  * [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
  * [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) to compile SCSS

### Install and Run the Site Locally

1. Clone and change to the directory:

    ```sh
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mozilla/fx-private-relay.git
    cd fx-private-relay
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```sh
    virtualenv env
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install Python and Node requirements:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```


4. Copy `.env` file for
   [`decouple`](https://pypi.org/project/python-decouple/) config:

    ```sh
    cp .env-dist .env
    ```

5. Add a `SECRET_KEY` value to `.env`:

    ```ini
    SECRET_KEY=secret-key-should-be-different-for-every-install
    ```

6. Migrate DB:

    ```sh
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

7. Create superuser:

    ```sh
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

8. Run it:

    ```sh
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

### Working with translations
#### Getting the latest translations
We use a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
for translated message files. The `--recurse-submodules` step of installation
should bring the message files into your working directory already, but you may
want also want to udpate the translations after install. The easiest way to do
that is:

* `git submodule update --remote`

#### Add/update messages for translation
The `privaterelay/locales` directory is a git repository like any other, so to
make changes to the messages:

1. Make whatever changes you need in `privaterelay/locales/en` as you work.

2. `cd privaterelay/locales/en`

3. `git branch message-updates-yyyymmdd`

4. `git push -u origin message-updates-yyyymmdd`

You can then open a pull request from the `message-updates-yyyymmdd` branch to
[the l10n repo](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/fx-private-relay-l10n) `main` branch.

#### Commit translations for release
To commit updates to the app's translations (e.g., before a release), we need
to commit this submodule update. So, if the updated translations are ready to
be committed into the app, you can `git add` the submodule just like any other
file:

* `git add privaterelay/locales`

You can then commit and push to set the app repository to the updated version
of the translations submodule:

* `git push`

#### Recommended: Enable Firefox Accounts authentication
To enable Firefox Accounts authentication on your local server, you can use the
"Firefox Private Relay local dev" OAuth app on accounts.stage.mozaws.net.

To do so:

1. Set `ADMIN_ENABLED=True` in your `.env` file

2. Go to [the django admin page to change the default
   site](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/sites/site/1/change/).

3. Change `example.com` to `127.0.0.1:8000` and click Save.

4. [Go to the django-allauth social app admin
page](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/socialaccount/socialapp/), sign in with the
superuser account you created above, and add a social app for Firefox Accounts:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Provider | Firefox Accounts |
| Name | `accounts.stage.mozaws.net` |
| Client id | `9ebfe2c2f9ea3c58 ` |
| Secret key | Request this from `#fx-private-relay-eng` Slack channel |
| Sites | `127.0.0.1:8000 ` -> Chosen sites |

Now you can sign into [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) with an
FxA. 

:warning: Remember that you'll need to use an account on https://accounts.stage.mozaws.net/, not
the production site, accounts.firefox.com.

<!-- #### Optional: Enable SES
TODO -->


### Optional: Install and run the add-on locally

*Note: The add-on is located in a [separate repo](https://github.com/mozilla/fx-private-relay-add-on/). See it for additional information on getting started.* 

The add-on adds Firefox UI to generate and auto-fill email addresses across the web. Running the add-on locally allows it to communicate with your local server (`127.0.0.1:8000`) instead of the production server (`relay.firefox.com`).

### Optional: Enable Premium Features

To enable the premium Relay features, we integrate with the [FXA Subscription
Platform](https://mozilla.github.io/ecosystem-platform/docs/features/sub-plat/sub-plat-overview).
At a high level, to set up Relay premium subscription, we:

1. [Enable Firefox Accounts Authentication](#recommended-enable-firefox-accounts-authentication) as described above.

2. Create a product & price in our [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/).
(Ask in #subscription-platform Slack channel to get access to our Stripe dashboard.)

3. Link free users of Relay to the appropriate SubPlat purchase flow.

4. Check users' FXA profile json for a `subscriptions` field to see if they can
   access a premium, subscription-only feature.

In detail:

1. [Enable Firefox Accounts Authentication](#recommended-enable-firefox-accounts-authentication) as described above.

2. Go to our [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/).
(Ask in #subscription-platform Slack channel to get access to our Stripe dashboard.)

3. Create a new product in Stripe.

4. Add all [required `product:` metadata](https://github.com/mozilla/fxa/blob/a0c7ac2b4bad0412a0f3a25fc82b5670922f8957/packages/fxa-auth-server/lib/routes/validators.js#L396-L437).
   * Note: each piece of this metadata must have a `product:` prefix. So, for
     example, `webIconURL` must be entered as `product:webIconURL`.

5. Add `capabilities:` metadata.
   * Note: Each piece of this metadata must have a format like
     `capabilities:<fxa oauth client ID>`, and the value is a free-form string
     to describe the "capability" that purchasing the subscription gives to the
     user. E.g., `capabilities:9ebfe2c2f9ea3c58` with value of `premium-relay`.

6. Set some env vars with values from the above steps:

| Var | Value |
|-------|-------|
| `FXA_SUBSCRIPTIONS_URL` | `https://accounts.stage.mozaws.net/subscriptions` |
| `PREMIUM_PROD_ID` | `prod_IyCWnXUbkYjDgL` (from Stripe)|
| `PREMIUM_PRICE_ID` | `price_1IMG7KKb9q6OnNsL15Hsn1HE` (from Stripe)|
| `SUBSCRIPTIONS_WITH_UNLIMITED` | `"premium-relay"` (match the `capabilities` value you used in Stripe)|

#### Test Premium

There is a [comprehensive doc of test
cases](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fMl4LHr1kIuGHfS9jyhLrv5vAyJMBUCr2AP0sODFmJw/edit#gid=0) for purchasing premium Relay.

You can use [Stripe's test credit card details](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards) for payment.

## Production Environments

### Requirements
In addition to the requirements for dev, production environments should use:

* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)-compatible DB

### Environment Variables
Production environments should also set some additional environment variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>
DJANGO_SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS=15768000
DJANGO_SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True
```
