/**
 * Wraps @fluent/react's Localized to be consistent between prerender and first render
 *
 * React will throw a tantrum if the HTML rendered during the build differs from
 * the DOM rendered by React when running client-side. However, at build-time we
 * don't yet know the user's locale. Thus, if we render strings in the user's
 * locale on the first client-side render, we'll make React unhappy, and who
 * wants that?
 *
 * To work around this, the useL10n hook makes sure that the English strings are
 * rendered when both prerendering and doing the first client-side render, and
 * only after that use the language that aligns with the user's preferences.
 * Thus, while pre-rendering and during the first client-side render, we call
 * out to that hook.
 *
 * This means tags embedded in the localised strings won't get added initially,
 * but since that's only for SEO and the initial render, that's acceptable.
