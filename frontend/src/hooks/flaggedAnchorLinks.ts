/**
 * Fix anchor links to elements behind a feature flag
 *
 * Some elements are not shown on page load, because they should not be visible
 * to everyone â€” typically, we'll have to first inspect the reponse to the
 * `/runtime_data/` API endpoint to determine whether that is the case.
 *
 * That means that, if the page loads with an anchor link pointing to that
 * element (e.g. `#vpn_promo`), the browser by default won't scroll towards that
 * element, because it does not exist yet.
 *
 * This hook will wait until the data passed to it as dependencies comes in and,
 * when it does, initiate a scroll towards the target element.
 *
 * @param dependencies When this element changes, try scrolling again
 * @param allowedTargetElementIds Only scroll if elements with one of these IDs are the target
