## Relay: Release Engineer playbook

1. Tuesday PM: [Release to stage][Release-to-stage] (tag, Github release notes)

   a. Ping all the engineers who have changes in the release to:

   - Move cards to “Ready to Test” if necessary
   - Include instructions for QA to test

   b. Confirm any hotfixes are also in the new tag

2. Wednesday-Monday

   a. Use the [Sentry Releases][sentry-releases] report to watch for any new issues

   b. Co-ordinate, re-tag for [stage fixes][stage-fixes] as needed

   - Allow ample time for QA testing which are done during European hours

> [!WARNING]
> Don't tag after Thursday, so QA has a stable stage environment to test before the Tuesday deployment to production.

3. Monday

   a. [Release Readiness Review][release-ready] (led by Easy)

   - Demo changes already in prod
   - Highlight changes in upcoming release
   - Designate next release engineer

   b. [Write SRE ticket, mention authors, reference in release notes][release-to-prod]

4. Tuesday

   a. SRE releases the tag to production

   b. Update Github Release to current release

   c. Monitor Sentry for production issues

   d. Hand-off Release Engineer duty to next engineer in rotation (GOTO 1.)
