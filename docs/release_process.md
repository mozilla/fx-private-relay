# Release Process

## Environments

- [Production][prod] - Run by SRE team in GCP
- [Stage][stage] - Run by SRE team in GCP
- [Dev][dev] - Run by ENGR team in MozCloud
- Locals: Run by ENGRs on their own devices. (See [README][readme] and other [`docs/`][docs].)

## Code branches

Standard Relay development follows a branching strategy similar to
[GitHub Flow][github-flow], where all branches stem directly from `main` and
are merged back to `main`:

1. Create a branch from `main`
2. Make changes
3. Create a pull request to `main`
4. Address review comments
5. Merge pull request

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'theme': 'base', 'gitGraph': {'rotateCommitLabel': true} } }%%
    gitGraph
       commit
       branch change-1
       commit
       commit
       checkout main
       merge change-1
```

This means many features could be in development at the same time, and all can
merge back to `main` when they are ready.

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'theme': 'base', 'gitGraph': {'rotateCommitLabel': true} } }%%
    gitGraph
       commit
       branch change-1
       commit
       commit
       checkout main
       branch change-2
       commit
       checkout main
       merge change-1
       branch change-3
       commit
       commit
       checkout main
       merge change-2
       checkout change-3
       commit
       commit
       checkout main
```

## Release Timeline

The standard release interval for Relay is 1 week, meaning every week there
will be a new version of the Relay web app on the [Production][prod]
environment. To do this, we first release code to [Dev][dev] and
[Stage][stage].

## Release to Dev

Every commit to `main` is automatically deployed to the [Dev][dev] server.

**TODO** [MPP-4443][]: Add instructions for pushing an alternate branch in MozCloud.

[MPP-4443]: https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/browse/MPP-4443

## Release to Stage

Every tag pushed to GitHub is automatically deployed to the [Stage][stage]
server. The standard practice is to create a tag from `main` every Tuesday at
the end of the day, and to name the tag with `YYYY-MM-DD` [CalVer][calver]
syntax. This tag will include only the changes that have been merged to `main`.
E.g.,

1. `git tag 2022.08.02`
2. `git push --tags`

E.g., the following `2022.08.02` tag includes only `change-1` and `change-2`.

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'theme': 'base', 'gitGraph': {'rotateCommitLabel': true} } }%%
    gitGraph
       commit
       branch change-1
       commit
       commit
       checkout main
       branch change-2
       commit
       checkout main
       merge change-1
       branch change-3
       commit
       commit
       checkout main
       merge change-2 tag: "2022.08.02"
       checkout change-3
       commit
       commit
       checkout main
```

### Create Release Notes on GitHub

After you push the tag to GitHub, you should also
[make a pre-release on GitHub][github-new-release] for the tag.

1. Choose the tag you just pushed (e.g., `2022.08.02`)
2. Type the same tag name for the release title (e.g., `2022.08.02`)
3. Click "Previous tag:" and choose the tag for comparison.
   - If the last release was a standard release, use the release currently on production.
     You can find this at [the `__version__` endpoint][prod-version].
   - If the last release was a hot fix, use the "regular" release before the hot fix.
     For example, if the current release is `2022.08.02.1`, use `2022.08.02` as the
     previous release.
4. Click the "Generate release notes" button!
5. Edit the generated notes to add a planned release summary and organize PRs
   into sections, such as:

   ```text
   Planned for release to relay.firefox.com on August 9th, 2022.

   ## User-facing changes
   * PRs that will change what users see, good candidates for QA tests

   ### Upcoming Features
   * PRs that are behind feature flags, if any, with note: (behind flag `the_flag_name`)

   ## Other changes
   * PRs for backend changes, documentation, etc

   ## Dependency updates
   * All the Dependabot PRs

   **Full Changelog**: Keep the link generated from the automated GitHub release generation.
   ```

6. Check the pre-release box.
7. Click "Publish release"

## Release to Prod

We leave the tag on [Stage][stage] for a week so that we (and especially QA)
can check the tag on GCP infrastructure before we deploy it to production.

On Monday, after the Release Readiness Review:

1. File an [SRE ticket][sre-form] to deploy the tag to [Prod][prod].
   - Include a link to the GitHub Release
2. On the GitHub release, update the summary with a reference to the ticket:

   ```text
   Planned for release to relay.firefox.com on August 9th, 2022 with SVCSE-1385.
   ```

On Tuesday:

1. When SRE starts the deploy, "cloudops-jenkins" will send status messages
   into the #fx-private-relay-eng channel.
2. When you see `PROMOTE PROD COMPLETE`, do some checks on prod:
   - Spot-check the site for basic functionality
   - Check [sentry prod project](https://mozilla.sentry.io/releases/?environment=prod) for a spike in any new issues
   - Check [grafana dashboard](https://earthangel-b40313e5.influxcloud.net/d/qiwPC76Zk/fx-private-relay?orgId=1&refresh=1m&from=now-1h&to=now) for any unexpected spike in ops
   - (optional) [Run end-to-end tests](https://github.com/mozilla/fx-private-relay/actions/workflows/playwright.yml) on prod (Note: as of 2023-07-12 these are known-broken. ðŸ˜¢)
3. Update the GitHub release:

   - Update the summary:

     ```text
     Released to relay.firefox.com on August 9th, 2022 with SVCSE-1385.
     ```

   - De-select "Set as a pre-release",
   - Select "Set as the latest release"
   - Click "Update release"

## Stage-fixes

Ideally, every change can ride the regular weekly release "trains". But
sometimes we need to make and release changes before the regularly scheduled
release.

### "Clean `main`" flow

If a bug is caught on [Stage][stage] in a tag that is scheduled to go to
[Prod][prod], we need to fix the bug before the scheduled prod deploy. If
`main` is "clean" - i.e., nothing else has merged yet, we can use the regular
GitHub Flow:

1. Create a stage-fix branch from the tag. E.g.:
   - `git branch stage-fix-2022.08.02 2022.08.02`
   - `git switch stage-fix-2022.08.02`
2. Make changes
3. Create a pull request to `main`
4. Address review comments
5. Merge pull request
6. Make and push a new tag. E.g.: `2022.08.02.1`

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'theme': 'base' } }%%
    gitGraph
       commit
       branch change-1
       commit
       commit
       checkout main
       branch change-2
       commit
       checkout main
       merge change-1
       branch change-3
       commit
       commit
       checkout main
       merge change-2 tag: "2022.08.02"
       checkout change-3
       commit
       commit
       checkout main
       branch stage-fix-2022.08.02
       commit
       checkout main
       merge stage-fix-2022.08.02 tag: "2022.08.02.1"
```

### "Dirty `main`" flow

If a bug is caught on [Stage][stage] in a tag that is scheduled to go to
[Prod][prod], we need to fix the bug before the scheduled prod deploy. If
`main` is "dirty" - i.e., other changes have merged, we can make the new tag
from the stage-fix branch.

1. Create a stage-fix branch from the tag. E.g.:
   - `git branch stage-fix-2022.08.02 2022.08.02`
   - `git switch stage-fix-2022.08.02`
2. Make changes
3. Create a pull request to `main`
4. Address review comments
5. Merge pull request
6. Make and push a new tag _from the `stage-fix` branch_

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'theme': 'base' } }%%
    gitGraph
       commit
       branch change-1
       commit
       commit
       checkout main
       branch change-2
       commit
       checkout main
       merge change-1
       branch change-3
       commit
       commit
       checkout main
       merge change-2 tag: "2022.08.02"
       checkout change-3
       commit
       commit
       checkout main
       branch stage-fix-2022.08.02
       commit tag: "2022.08.02.1"
       checkout main
       merge change-3
       merge stage-fix-2022.08.02
```

### Creating GitHub Release Notes for stage-fix release

Whether you make a "clean" or "dirty" stage-fix, after you push the new tag to
GitHub, you should [make a pre-release on GitHub][github-new-release] for the
new release tag.

1. Choose the tag you just pushed (e.g., `2022.08.02.1`)
2. Type the same tag name for the release title (e.g., `2022.08.02.1`)
3. Click "Previous tag:" and choose the previous tag. (e.g., `2022.08.02`)
4. Click the "Generate release notes" button!
5. Check the pre-release box.
6. Click "Publish release"

## Example of regular release + "clean" stage-fix release + regular release

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'theme': 'base' } }%%
    gitGraph
       commit
       branch change-1
       commit
       commit
       checkout main
       branch change-2
       commit
       checkout main
       merge change-1
       branch change-3
       commit
       commit
       checkout main
       merge change-2 tag: "2022.08.02"
       checkout change-3
       commit
       commit
       checkout main
       branch stage-fix-1
       commit
       checkout main
       merge stage-fix-1 tag: "2022.08.02.1"
       checkout main
       merge change-3
       branch change-4
       commit
       checkout main
       branch change-5
       commit
       commit
       commit
       checkout main
       merge change-4
       merge change-5 tag: "2022.08.09"
```

## Future

Since the "clean main" flow is simpler, we are working towards a release
process where `main` is _always_ clean - even if changes have been merged to
it. To keep `main` clean, we will need to make use of feature-flags to
effectively hide any changes that are not ready for production. See the
[feature flags][feature-flags] docs for more.

When we are confident that `main` can always be released, we may get rid of
release tags completely, and move to something more like a GitLab Flow where we
merge from `main` to long-running branches for `dev`, `stage`, `pre-prod`, and
`prod` environments.
