          First, you’ll need a Firefox account. Then, use your account to sign up for the waiting list. When a spot opens, we’ll send you an email with a link you can use to complete registration and start using Relay.

          What happens if I reply to a relay email?
        </h2>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          We don’t yet offer the ability to reply with the relay address. If you try, nothing will happen. We are working on additional features to let you reply with a nice message and make replies actually work.
