"""
Check that a healthcheck JSON file exists and is recent.

A healthcheck file with JSON is loaded. If the timestamp (a string, formated
like Python's datetime.isoformat) is too far in the past, it exits with a
non-zero exit code. This makes it suitable for Kubernetes liveness checks of
processes without a webservice.

See:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.isoformat
